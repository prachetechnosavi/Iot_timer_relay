What it does?
This IoT timer relay is a simple electronic device that will allow us to keep the mains supply turned on for a set time duration. Wherever timed switching is needed this device can be used. In general, this will prevent wastage of electrical energy and also protect our electronic devices. 

How the time is set?
The time duration is set from a webpage served by ESP-01, this doesn’t requires internet. We are using ESP8266 in AP (Access point) mode. In this mode it generates it’s own hotspot. All you need is a smartphone/PC/Laptop, which can connect to hotspot and display webpages with the help of browser.
